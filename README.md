# SQA-final-assignement

## Introduction

Today's software applications are increasingly complex, often operating in multi-layer and multi-platform environments, and built in fast and agile conditions with ambitious requirements. In this complex scenario, software quality assurance and testing becomes even more critical as a means of **improving quality** and **minimizing risk**, responding to market demands and business needs. We are going to go through all these good practices through a sample project. This project is a software component in **Python** to store information about surveys and responses. The project is available in the repository where this document can be found. This document is a reference guide for best practices. The purpose of this document is to show the best practices to be adopted in the development of a project. This document covers the following themes : 

- [**Sprint backlog and task estimation**](#sprint-backlog-and-task-estimation)

- [**Project Documentation**](#project-documentation)

- [**Unit testing and Test-Driven development**](#unit-testing-and-test-driven-development)

- [**Test coverage metric**](#test-coverage-metric)

- [**Team version-control**](#team-version-control)

- [**Code-review checklist**](#code-review-checklist)
