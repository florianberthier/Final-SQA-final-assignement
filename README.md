# SQA-final-assignement

## Introduction

Today's software applications are increasingly complex, often operating in multi-layer and multi-platform environments, and built in fast and agile conditions with ambitious requirements. In this complex scenario, software quality assurance and testing becomes even more critical as a means of **improving quality** and **minimizing risk**, responding to market demands and business needs. We are going to go through all these good practices through a sample project. This project is a software component in **Python** to store information about surveys and responses. The project is available in the repository where this document can be found. This document is a reference guide for best practices. The purpose of this document is to show the best practices to be adopted in the development of a project. This document covers the following themes : 

- [**Sprint backlog and task estimation**](#sprint-backlog-and-task-estimation)

- [**Project Documentation**](#project-documentation)

- [**Unit testing and Test-Driven development**](#unit-testing-and-test-driven-development)

- [**Test coverage metric**](#test-coverage-metric)

- [**Team version-control**](#team-version-control)

- [**Code-review checklist**](#code-review-checklist)

## Sprint backlog and task estimation

## Project Documentation

## Unit testing and Test-Driven development

Testing is the basis of a successful project. It is imperative that you provide tests for each of your code additions. The tests must be complete, i.e. test all possible cases. The name of the test should be the same as the name of the function being tested to simplify the work of other developers.
